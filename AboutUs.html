      <h3>Warning Signs of Bullying</h3>
      <p>There are many warning signs that may indicate that someone is affected by bullying—either being bullied or bullying others.<br> Recognizing the warning signs is an important first step in taking action against bullying. Not all children who are bullied or <br>are bullying others ask for help.
        It is important to talk with children who show signs of being bullied or bullying others. <br>These warning signs can also point to other issues or problems, such as depression or substance abuse. Talking to the child can <br>help identify the root of the problem.</p>
      <h4>Signs a Child Is Being Bullied</h4>

      <p>Look for changes in the child. However, be aware that not all children who are bullied exhibit warning signs.</p>
      <p>Some signs that may point to a bullying problem are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unexplainable injuries</li>
        <li>Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry</li>
        <li>Frequent headaches or stomach aches, feeling sick or faking illness</li>
        <li>Changes in eating habits, like suddenly skipping meals or binge eating. Kids may come home from school hungry <br>because they did not eat lunch.</li>
        <li>Difficulty sleeping or frequent nightmares</li>
        <li>Declining grades, loss of interest in schoolwork, or not wanting to go to school</li>
        <li>Sudden loss of friends or avoidance of social situations</li>
        <li>Feelings of helplessness or decreased self esteem</li>
        <li>Self-destructive behaviors such as running away from home, harming themselves, or talking about suicide</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you know someone in serious distress or danger, don’t ignore the problem. Get help right away! </p>
      <h4>Signs a Child is Bullying Others</h4>

      <p>Kids may be bullying others if they:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get into physical or verbal fights</li>
        <li>Have friends who bully others</li>
        <li>Are increasingly aggressive</li>
        <li>Get sent to the principal’s office or to detention frequently</li>
        <li>Have unexplained extra money or new belongings</li>
        <li>Blame others for their problems</li>
        <li>Don’t accept responsibility for their actions</li>
        <li>Are competitive and worry about their reputation or popularity</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Why don't kids ask for help?</h4>
      <p>Statistics from the 2018 Indicators of School Crime and Safety - PDF<sup>[1]</sup> show that only 20% of school bullying incidents were <br>reported. Kids don’t tell adults for many reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bullying can make a child feel helpless. Kids may want to handle it on their own to feel in control again. They may fear <br>being seen as weak or a tattletale.</li>
        <li>Kids may fear backlash from the kid who bullied them.</li>
        <li>Bullying can be a humiliating experience. Kids may not want adults to know what is being said about them, whether true <br>or false. They may also fear that adults will judge them or punish them for being weak.</li>
        <li>Kids who are bullied may already feel socially isolated. They may feel like no one cares or could understand.</li>
        <li>Kids may fear being rejected by their peers. Friends can help protect kids from bullying, and kids can fear losing <br>this support.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Preventions of Bullying</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Be a friend to someone who is being bullied: <br>Walk with the target in the hall, sit with her at lunch, welcome her into your group, "friend" her on Facebook.</li>
        <li>Help the target talk to an adult: <br>Walk with her to a counselor's officer or a teacher, or make a witness report if you were there when the bullying occurred.</li>
        <li>Don't participate: <br>Avoid spreading rumors, contributing to online bullying, laughing at mean remarks, or actively adding to the bullying in <br>any way.</li>
        <li>Tell the bully to stop: <br>Assertively tell the bully that you don't like what she's doing, that it's bullying, and that it needs to stop. And always <br>speak to an adult when you witness bullying.</li>
        <li>Tell bystanders to stop:<br> If you see others participating in bullying or laughing along, tell them they're making the problem worse and are also <br>bullying. Stop untrue rumors.</li>
        <li>Reach out to newcomers: <br>If you notice a new person at your school, reach out to her; introduce her to your friends and make her feel welcome.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to think independently or be the only one voicing what others are probably thinking:<br> The people most celebrated in our culture are those who took the risk to speak out and stand up to injustice.</li>
        <li>Start an upstander club at your school:<br> Let others know you're an upstander and someone others can go to if they're being bullied.</li>
        <li>Talk to parents, teachers, principals, and staff about bullying at school:<br> Tell them where it's happening, and where kids need greater protection.</li>
        <li>Sign an anti-bullying pledge: <br>Write down your own commitment to preventing bullying, and ask your friends to sign their agreement.<sup>[3]</sup></li>
