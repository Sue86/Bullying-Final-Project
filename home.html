  <h3>What is Bullying?</h3>
    <!--Paragraph 2-->
  <div class="content">
  <div class="whatis">
    <p>Whether bullying is physical, verbal, or social (relational), four widely-accepted factors can be used to identify it:

    <ul>
      <li>Bullying is deliberate - harming another person intentionally.</li>
      <li>Bullying involves a misuse of power in a relationship.</li>
      <li>Bullying is usually not a one-off - it is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated over time.</li>
      <li>Bullying involves behaviour that can cause harm - it is not a normal part of growing up.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bullying can happen anywhere, in person or online (cyberbullying), at any time, and can be verbal, physical or social (relational). It can be obvious or hidden.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

      <!--Paragraph 3-->
      <p>There are many different types of bullying that can be experienced by children and adults alike, some are obvious to <br>spot while others can be more subtle. The different types of bullying that we look at below are some of the ways that <br>bullying could be happening.</p>
      <h4>Physical Bullying</h4>
      <p>Physical bullying includes hitting, kicking, tripping, pinching and pushing or damaging property.  Physical bullying <br>causes both short term and long-term damage.</p>
      <h4>Verbal Bullying</h4>
      <p>Verbal bulling includes name calling, insults, teasing, intimidation, homophobic or racist remarks, or verbal abuse. <br>While verbal bullying can start off harmless, it can escalate to levels which start affecting the individual target.</p>
      <h4>Social Bullying</h4>
      <p>Social bullying, sometimes referred to as covert bullying, is often harder to recognise and can be carried out behind the <br>bullied person’s back.  It is designed to harm someone’s social reputation and / or cause humiliation.</p>
      <p>Social bullying can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>lying and spreading rumors</li>
        <li>negative facial or physical gestures, menacing or contemptuous looks</li>
        <li>playing nasty jokes to embarrass and humiliate</li>
        <li>mimicking unkindly</li>
        <li>encouraging others to social exclude someone</li>
        <li>damaging someone’s social reputation or social acceptance.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cyber Bullying</h4>
      <p>The Cyber Bullying Research Centre defines cyber bullying as:  Intentional and repeated harm inflicted through the use of<br> computers, phones, and other electronic devices.</p>
      <p>Cyber bullying can be overt or covert bullying behaviors using digital technologies including hardware such as computers<br> and smartphones, and software such as social media, instant messaging, texts, websites and other online platforms.</p>
      <p>Cyber bullying can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>abusive or hurtful texts, emails or posts, images or videos</li>
        <li>deliberately excluding others online</li>
        <li>nasty gossip or rumors</li>
        <li>imitating others online or using their log-in<sup>[2]</sup></li>
      </ul>
